        		<h1>blog.</h1>
                <h2>december 24, 2020.</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my blog! I initially thought about creating a Medium account, but perhaps I'll do both? Anyway, it's Christmas Eve and I just checked my marks for 4/5 of my classes in my 1A term. My marks were pretty much where I expected them to be (if not better), but I still can't help but feel a bit underwhelmed. Maybe it's the pandemic impacting my feelings, but I guess this whole first term just wasn't what I had hoped for. I feel a bit numb, a bit amazed that I'm in university in the first place, and so, so tired. Next term I anticipate that I'll have to do all my classes online, so I imagine the fatigue I feel from self-directed learning and Zoom/Teams calls will only be more intense. Do things feel a bit bleak? Yes. But will I survive? Also yes.</p>
                <p>It's been a nice two days since my last final. I drove on the highway for the first time in over a year today. It felt like the tires on my car were on the verge of flying off, but other than that it went smoothly.</p>
                <h2>january 7, 2021.</h2>
                <p>Happy New Year! Actually, I don't know if this year is deserving of an exclamation mark. Despite the initial hope that 2021 would be different from 2020, it's been the same, if not worse. Yesterday's news (the attack on the US Capitol) left me in shock and anger. To me, what was most jarring was the blatant hypocrisy in the response to the riots. I am certain that if it weren't for their skin colour, these rioters (actually, it is equally fitting to call them terrorists) would not have been able to go home without a scratch. I konw my feelings cannot compare, but I can't even begin to imagine the hurt that POC in the United States must have felt knowing that these people were destroying property, fighting against law enforcement, disrupting work, and GETTING AWAY WITH IT. It also angers me that taxpayers will have to pay to repair the damage created.</p>
                <p>I think that through this pandemic, my world has slowed and I've been paying much more attention to the world around me. I've spent much more time developing my own opinions by reading and learning about the experiences of others. I've also been allowing myself to feel all the rage, happiness, and shock that comes with our society and how it functions. In isolation, I think there is a lot of room for growth and self-discovery. It's easier to be introspective or retrospective when there's nothing to distract you, no excuses to keep you busy.</p>
