        		<h1>blog.</h1>
                <h2>december 24, 2020.</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my blog! I initially thought about creating a Medium account, but perhaps I'll do both? Anyway, it's Christmas Eve and I just checked my marks for 4/5 of my classes in my 1A term. My marks were pretty much where I expected them to be (if not better), but I still can't help but feel a bit underwhelmed. Maybe it's the pandemic impacting my feelings, but I guess this whole first term just wasn't what I had hoped for. I feel a bit numb, a bit amazed that I'm in university in the first place, and so, so tired. Next term I anticipate that I'll have to do all my classes online, so I imagine the fatigue I feel from self-directed learning and Zoom/Teams calls will only be more intense. Do things feel a bit bleak? Yes. But will I survive? Also yes.</p>
                <p>It's been a nice two days since my last final. I drove on the highway for the first time in over a year today. It felt like the tires on my car were on the verge of flying off, but other than that it went smoothly.</p>
                <h2>january 7, 2021.</h2>
                <p>Happy New Year! Actually, I don't know if this year is deserving of an exclamation mark. Despite the initial hope that 2021 would be different from 2020, it's been the same, if not worse. Yesterday's news (the attack on the US Capitol) left me in shock and anger. To me, what was most jarring was the blatant hypocrisy in the response to the riots. I am certain that if it weren't for their skin colour, these rioters (actually, it is equally fitting to call them terrorists) would not have been able to go home without a scratch. I konw my feelings cannot compare, but I can't even begin to imagine the hurt that POC in the United States must have felt knowing that these people were destroying property, fighting against law enforcement, disrupting work, and GETTING AWAY WITH IT. It also angers me that taxpayers will have to pay to repair the damage created, money that could have gone to fund COVID-19 efforts. However, I still have hope that the upcoming transition of power will bring better things for the future.</p>
                <p>I think that through this pandemic, my world has slowed and I've been paying much more attention to the world around me. I've spent much more time developing my own opinions by reading and learning about the experiences of others. I've also been allowing myself to feel all the rage, happiness, and shock that comes with our society and how it functions. In isolation, I think there is a lot of room for growth and self-discovery. It's easier to be introspective or retrospective when there's nothing to distract you, no excuses to keep you busy.</p>
                <p>As I'm trying to make the most of my last few days of break, I've been clinging onto nostalgia. I don't want to sound pretentious, but I think listening to old Taylor Swift albums, mulling over moments in past relationships, and going through childhood photos have helped me see more of the big picture in my life. I'm filled with anxiety over my 1B term: I'm anxious that I won't be able to find work and pay tuition, anxious that this pandemic may affect my family and friends, anxious that the pandemic may never end, and of course, anxious that I'm not smart enough to do well in my overloaded term. But I find peace in the traces of my past self... like a small voice telling me I've gotten through everything before, and I will get through everything to come. I see so much in the past version of me who pored over the lyric booklet in the Speak Now album, the version of me who turned breakup drama into motivation, and the version of me who was elated to get into the program she thought was a stretch for herself. I guess looking at who I was in the past gives me hope for my future, because I am the same girl who did all of those things and who will go on to do more.</p>
