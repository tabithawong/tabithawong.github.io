                GoodDay is a Chrome extension built with self-care in mind. Upon installation, users can click on the extension logo and they will be greeted with a self-care reminder or a positive quote. It also generates uplifting photos of beautiful nature, cute animals, or serene study spaces. Users can update their photo preferences to only show photos from certain categories. Finally, the extension also has a "to-do" list function. This extension was created with three other Waterloo CS students for Hack the North 2021. The link above is to our project's Devpost page. The extension website can be found <a class="grow" href = "https://gooddays.tech" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

                Safe at School is a web-based interactive game that aims to teach elementary school students how to follow public health guidelines for COVID-19 at school. Users are greeted with a personalized welcome screen after entering their name. They are then led through a series of realistic situations that may occur in a regular school day. This game was created with a team of three other Waterloo CS students for the 2020 Ignition Hacks hackathon. It was the winner for the "Best Presentation" category for Division Delta. The Devpost link above also contains links to my team's Github repository and to the game itself so you can give it a try! The game is best enjoyed on Google Chrome with the volume up!</p>

                <p>This simulation (created with Processing) depicts the growth of mould on a slice of raisin bread. It incorporates cellular automata concepts in order to decide if a cell becomes mouldy or not. Users can change a variety of factors to influence mould growth, such as light, temperature, and humidity. </p>
