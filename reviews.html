                <h2>melodrama album.</h2>
                    <p>The Melodrama album has been a staple in my library since it was released in 2017. It falls in and out of my playlists but I always find myself rediscovering it and falling in love with it all over again. I remember listening to "Green Light" when it first came out on the radio. It was a great song to dance around my room to, but I guess I didn't fully understand it then. I remember listening to "The Louvre" in the fall, sitting on my deck doing homework. I remember thinking the song was all about the giddyness you feel in a new relationship. The excitement and the "violence" of your heartbeat as you fall hard and fast into things. I also listened to "Liability" a lot as I navigated my first relationship. It was a relationship where I did a lot of waiting: waiting for him to call, waiting for him to have a free moment to text, waiting to grow up so we could do what we wanted. I felt like a big liability to him because I felt helpless and needy... Just someone weighing him down in the back of his mind.</p>
                    <p>Then when we broke up I defaulted to the breakup songs on the album: "Hard Feelings/LOVELESS", "Writer in the Dark", and most notably "Supercut". I love "Hard Feelings" because it perfectly captured the late stages of a relationship: asking him to be tender as you awkwardly end things, looking back on how "real" the feelings were to you, and the slow repair you do on yourself. "Writer in the Dark" was pretty empowering for me. It felt like it was reminding me over and over again that I could just turn this around and accomplish great things, so much that he'd "rue" me and the relationship. Finally, "Supercut" was the song I looped over and over again at night, which was when the distractions were all taken away and I would feel the loss the most. It's a song tinged with regret and longing for the past. The supercut is really just a montage of the beautiful memories that you think of when you think of the relationship. Lorde says they're fluorescent and wild and that she wishes he'd come home to her heart.</p>
                    <p>In hindsight, the whole situation is pretty naive and obviously/painfully/laughably melodramatic. But that's first love, right? Anyway, with time I can now see how flawed my interpretations of certain songs were. THe whole album feels like one reflective, sad, slightly self-destructive house party. There's a moment where you're sitting in the bathroom, half-drunk, crying about a breakup. Another moment where you're carelessly dancing to music. Another moment where you're so angry at him and you're yelling to your friends because "he's such a liar he told her he loves going to the beach HE HATES GOING TO THE BEACH". It's youth and it's dramatic and it's so perfect!!!</p>
                    <p>In conclusion I adore this album and I will come back to it at least twice a year.</p>
